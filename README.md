# Ultrasound-Breast-Cancer-Classification
Abstract: Breast cancer remains a significant health concern worldwide, necessitating early detection and treatment for improved patient outcomes. This article focuses on the development of a breast cancer classification model using machine learning techniques applied to public ultrasound images. The primary objective is to assist in the early detection of breast cancer, enabling timely interventions and improved treatment efficacy. There are a few rarer types of breast cancer often looked over, which is what our code takes into account. CNN models have previously been used and shown to be the best for classifying images of this manner. We built a CNN, VGG16, VGG19, and Resnet-50 model to classify between ultrasound images of benign and malignant tumors. We also included images without any tumor as a control for our model. Our VGG 19 model achieved the highest training accuracy of 78.41% and takes new images from the web or as an upload for classification.
